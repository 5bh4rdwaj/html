<li>

  Dont ever come to his office during lunch.
<li>Dont talk in Hindi to him. If you talk in English or Farsi, he'll respect you like a boss.
 <li>NEVER ever take up a mess with Hemlata Ma'am.
<li>Score as much as you can. Because your section determines how much anger he's gonna vent out on you.
<li>If you attend competions and you're average in studies, provided that you're not in A section. He's going to love you like his Dog.
<li>Try not to be late to school.
<li>Don't take up fights in the school.
<li>Don't spend much time (if you're a guy) around the toilet during the IInd half. If you're he probably does'nt care (apparently you people go on some pilgrimage there!!)
