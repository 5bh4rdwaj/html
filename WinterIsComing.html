    <b>Astapor raided by Deneraus Stormborn (Tagareyan):</b>
    The city of "Astapor" across the narrow sea has been taken by Deneres Stormborn and her Dragons. This event likely took place after the Mother of Dragons bought all of the unsullied in th exchange of her largest dragons. After assuming command, she orered the unsullied to kill all slave masters and unchain any slave they see. The city of Astapor, its navy and its riches are now commanded by the Mothr of Dragons,
    It's also been known that she commands her troops in Valyrian, which further unites them with her. She had made a proprsal in front of all "slaves", that they are now free men and can choose wheather to leave and live their own lives or follow Deneres
